# MTN-Project
The MTN project was done on mobile users in Cote d’Ivoire to try and determine the best strategy the company can adopt in upgrading its technology infrastructure.
The data presented included all cities in Cote dÍvoire and the products thier mobile users use i.e Voice, Data and sms. The data was first cleaned and all irrelevant rows of data were dropped in order to have a final data set to aid in analysis.
From the analysis it emerged that voice was the most used product and data was the least. Some of the cities use voice product more than others as well as the other products.
A summary of the findings can be found in the data analysis report.
